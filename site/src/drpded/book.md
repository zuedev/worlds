<!-- Why science fiction? -->

I believe that science fiction is the most important literature in the history of the world, because it's also the history of the consequences of ideas. It's an exploration of the future, and what might be. It shows us not only where we might be headed, but also where we might wind up if we're not careful. It is a warning, a vision, a promise, a possibility. Science fiction provides us a window into the future for us to both enjoy immersing ourselves in, and to reflect upon our own lives and actions. It is a genre that is both entertaining and thought-provoking, and it is a genre that has the power to change the world.

<!-- And...? -->

That's why I find the genre so fascinating. It's a genre that is constantly evolving, and it's a genre that is constantly challenging our perceptions of the world around us. Able to be infinitely inspiring whilst equally terrifying. This contradiction of somehow-coexisting dichotomy is what fuels me to write at all. To be able to imagine a setting that takes my own experiences, opinions, and beliefs, and then twist them into something that is both familiar and alien at the same time. That's the power of science fiction.

<!-- Why Cyberpunk? -->

Cyberpunk is a perfect example of this divide in thinking. You have an awe-inspiring world of technology and innovation, but at the same time, you have a world that is dark, gritty, and dangerous. The very line between man and machine is blurred, prompting boundless questions of morality, ethics, and the very nature of what it means to be "human."

<!-- Inspiration -->

Back in January of 2013, I distinctly remember the moment I first discovered Cyberpunk. I was 15 years old, supposed to be studying for my year 11 exams, but instead, I was in my room playing Mass Effect 3 for the third time in a row. It was only when a friend of mine recommended a YouTube video to me that I was able to break free from the game's grasp. The video was a teaser for an upcoming game called "Cyberpunk 2077" by CD Projekt Red. It featured a neon-lit cityscape that played backdrop to a scene of highly-augmented police officers engaging in a firefight with a woman surrounded by bodies. This woman had a gun to her head, and as the camera panned around to show her face in full, where it was revealed that her arms were unfolded into a pair of mantis-like blades. This entire time the song "Bullets" by Archive was playing in the background. I was hooked.

It wouldn't be until the E3 of 2018 that we would see more of the game, but by then, I had already been introduced to the genre of Cyberpunk through the works of William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, and, of course, Mike Pondsmith. Nevertheless, what we got that year from CD Projekt Red was nothing short of breathtaking. The game was a visual masterpiece, with a visual style that captured the essence of Cyberpunk perfectly. It was a world of neon lights, towering skyscrapers, and dark alleyways that hosted a myriad of cybernetics and otherworldly technology. I watched that trailer so many times that I remember the voiceover word for word. Specifically, the line "This city's always got a promise for you. Might be a lie, an illusion, but it's there, just around the corner. And it keeps you going." That line had me living day-dreams of the world that was just revealed to me.

<!-- When does writing start? -->

I remember sitting in the car on long drives, staring out the window, imagining myself in that world to the music I always had playing in my headphones. I would imagine mercs, runners, 'borgs, corpos, and even lawmen all doing their thing in Night City. It was this part of my life that I started to take my writing more seriously, focussing on augmenting my weekly TTRPG sessions with my friends to be able to tell more interesting stories. I would write up scenarios, characters, and settings that would be used in our games. It was a way for me to escape, to be able to fly past the walls of my room and into worlds locked away in my mind. It was a way for me to be able to tell stories that I wanted to hear, and to be able to share them with others I cared about.
