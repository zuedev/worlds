**Feature: Hold the Line**

Whilst wielding a shield or greatsword, you can use a bonus action or reaction to brace yourself. Once activated, your speed is reduced to 0 and you are completely immovable. This feature can only be deactivated if you are made unconscious, are incapacitated, or if you use an action to relax.

**Suggested Characteristics**

Use the tables for the Soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as an Empire legionnaire.

Your bond almost always involves the legion to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a legionnaire's ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one's legion.
