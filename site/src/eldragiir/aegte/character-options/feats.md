## Wind Run

**Prerequisites:** Monk (Way of the Four Elements)

You have become adept at manipulating the air in contact with your body to the degree that you can create a pressure difference great enough to boost your speed temporarily. Once per day, you can take the "Wind Run" action to increase your speed for one round. This increase is equal to your monk level multiplied by 10. A level 5 monk with a speed of 30 feet, for example, would have a new speed of 80 feet per round.
