# An Explorer's Guide to Eldragiir

> Birthed from the embers of war and left to rot by its creators, the world of Eldragiir is a chaotic realm of mad-gods and foolish mortals. Forces clash for control over precious artefacts left behind by a once-great ancient civilisation known as "the Precursors." With dark entities festering and scheming between the folds in the fabric of reality, to live here is to know strife and betrayal.

## Information

Eldragiir is a worldbuilding project born from playing countless hours of Dungeons & Dragons. Inspired heavily from media I was exposed to in my life, I hope to one day be able to share this with others in a more significant way.

This repository is split into two main parts:

- **"AEGTE"** - a guide much like a sourcebook for Dungeons & Dragons to help others implement this content into their games.
- **"Wiki"** - the main content of this repository, a collection of articles and other entries that help me keep track of this project and its intricacies. I am not a consistent writer, but I'm trying to improve!

I will also be using this space as storage for maps and tidbits I use in my campaigns, as well as anything else I see relevant to the project.
