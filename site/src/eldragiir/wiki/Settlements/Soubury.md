There is a hatred between Norbury and Soubury. Click [here](./Norbury.md) to see more.

## History:

It is estimated that between the years 237-218 PrC, Human and Elf settlers, travelling from the south west portion of the Guilded Coast, established a trading post near current day Soubury. They chose this location for the ease of access to the river, as well as the commonality of fish. The Buryian's to the north contacted the Human/Elf settlement in hopes of opening potential trade routes. After a few years of debate, a deal was struck. There was a road developed between the two settlements. For the next 60 years or so, the populations intermixed between locations. It was decided, in the winter of 35 PrC, to officially incorporate a name for each settlement. A small group of Orcs, Elves and Humans came together and decided to keep the Buryan name to recognize the struggles that the Orcs went through. The terms Nor and Sou were introduced for directionality purposes. Hence, Norbury and Soubury. These two villages worked in tandem for a few years. In the year 0 PoC, the cataclysm event occurred. This event affected Norbury and Soubury as the river trade route was inaccessible further towards the coast. For several years, Soubury became poorer and poorer to the point where some individuals killed for food. In 13 PrC, a representative from Greenborough travelled to both towns and learned about what happened. The government of Greenborough decided that they could take advantage of this situation for monetary gain. Over the next couple of years, representatives altered Souburian's history intending to vilify Norburians. They did this to make Greenborough the sole proprietor of products developed in Soubury. To this day, citizens of Soubury hate Norburians.

## Geography:

Located south of Norbury, the town is situated on the North-Western Run river.

**Climate:** Throughout the Spring to Fall period, the temperature averages between 11-15°C. During the winter, the temperature averages below 5°C. Every so often, during the winter season, the river becomes frozen with a thin layer of ice.

**Architecture:** Many buildings within current Soubury follow an old architectural style first developed by Humans. This type of building consists of a wooden frame filled in with sticks. The holes in the frame were then filled with mud and clay to support the frame. Many of the roofs are thatched using dry vegetation, a process that was timely and non-resourceful. This construction process is sometimes called "wattle and daub". Although this is more of a primitive building process, it requires little to no maintenance. The Church to Ethe, located on the northern side of the village, is the most complex in its construction. It is very similar in construction to the Winterraine Church located in Norbury. It contains one tower and a small spire. On the exterior of the structure, two transepts are to be noted on both sides. It is not known why these two transepts seem incomplete.

## Government:

Directly controlled by the Gilded Reguntii (local governors of the Guilded Coast). These governors operate under the Ministry of Governance (Admintorum Ministorii). Click [here](../Organisations/The-Emperor's-Realm.md) to see the government breakdown.

**Defences:** Soubury doesn't have any "official" form of military personnel. The only natural defence this town has is access to the river in case of an attack, some of the population could escape by boat. The government doesn't allow Soubury to maintain a militia, however the population is allowed to arm themselves individually for personal defence. In terms of government military intervention: when necessary, the 7th legion could send military personnel to the area to control any local discourse.

**Infrastructure:** Soubury doesn't maintain any public form of transit. There are predetermined paths for ease of access around the village. In terms of transport, fishermen have access to small boats to travel to Greenborough every season to deliver fish.

## Demographics:

Around 650. Human (41%), Orc (36%), Elf (24%).

**Religion:** Sanguinalum. The Church to Ethe is located on the northern side of town. This church is the oldest known building within the village. Every 5 days, the people of Soubury gather at Ethe to hold a service. Once every 100 days, a large formal service is held outside the church to observe the change of season.

## Economy:

The average Souburian lives a generally impoverished life. While the fishing trade does bring in income, it is sparse enough to prevent economic growth.

**Industry & Trade:** Soubury directly exports several types of river fish. In particular, the most common fish exported is called Bluekarp. This fish can also be turned into a jerky through a process known as smoking dehydration. They do this to "out-export" Norbury in terms of variety of products. Not only does this jerky expand the uses that Bluekarp has to the town, but it contains a naturally salty property that serves as a tasty snack.

**Class Structure:** Due to the low population, Soubury doesn't have a specific class system.
