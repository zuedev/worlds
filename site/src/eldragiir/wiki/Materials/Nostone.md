## Prose

Nostone is a chalky sedimentary rock composed of recrystallized nolcite found deep in the expanse of The Maw, originally mined and processed by the inhabitants of Nostro. It has anti-magical properties that manifest when the stone is subject to a magic effect. Nostone is commonly used for defensive applications, though it is not very resistant to physical damage.

## Properties

### Material Characteristics

Naturally-occurring Nostone is completely white and coarsely-grained. The processing of Nostone reveals a semi-translucent wavy pattern that can either be a salmon-pink or blue-grey colour. Completely odourless by itself, Nostone emits a powerful smell of gunpowder only when it actively counteracts nearby magic, which dissipates quickly within a few minutes. Nostone tastes sweet and chalky, with a very subtle hint of liquorice. It isn't known to be particularly harmful when ingested.
